\subsection{Comparison and Choice of Flight plan}
Between the two proposed flight plans, the first flight plan was chosen for the following reasons: (1) The first flight plan moves the waypoints intermittently during the turning maneuver, allowing for a more stable turning of the heading with minimum overshoot. (2) In case of the second flight plan with fixed waypoints, it is plausible that the turning of the heading may not be sufficient to avoid the obstacle. This is a weakness compared to the first flight plan where the turning of $90^o$ is guaranteed when confronting the obstacle. (3) Finally, the second flight plan could not be fully tested or verified due to the limited time. Nevertheless, the flight plan using the fixed waypoints has a strong advantage over the first flight plan as it can allow the drone to achieve a high-speed flight. This can be elaborated in the future work.
