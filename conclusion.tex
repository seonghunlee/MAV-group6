The drone performed well in terms of not crashing at all. The vision algorithm worked as required as all obstacles were detected and the drone turned away from them. On the other hand, it was quite slow in moving, resulting in not much distance flown. This speed had to be low to react before colliding with an obstacle. Another limitation was the dependency on the tuning. The drone had a good performace on orange and black obstacles as it has been tuned on them, but had some troubles with other colors or patterns.

The flight plan was a succes. Both the fixed waypoint and moving waypoint method could keep the drone inside the competition area and moved the drone from one waypoint to another. To prevent the drone from being trapped a breakthrough maneuver, temporary blinding and a circular flight area can give solution.
