\subsection{Linear Simulation}

%\textcolor{red}{Yazdi's method and results}
In order to grasp the concept of the computer vision, a linear simulation program is developed in MATLAB. The simulation program is also used to preliminary test the chosen strategy before the code implementation into the paparazzi system.  

\subsubsection{Model and Setup}
\textbf{The tournament field} is modeled based on our observation of the cyberzoo and the rules stated in the first announcement of the tournament, as shown in three example in Figure\ref{f:TopViewSamples}.

\textbf{Poles}, our initial assumption of the possible obstacle, are placed inside the obstacle field. Since there are no setup information, we choose to randomize the pole initial parameters, i.e., the pole number, the pole diameter and the x-y position, as shown in the table\ref{t:RandomPole} below. The ranges of position (x,y) are set to make the whole body of a pole to always be inside the obstacle area, considering the diameter ranges. Each pole are always separated by at least a certain distance, which is assumed to be 2 times the diameter of the drone. The height of the pole is assumed  to be constant of 2 meters. 

\begin{table}
\caption{Range of pole parameters randomization in the linear simulation}
\label{t:RandomPole}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lcc}
\hline \hline
Parameter & Range & Unit \\\hline
Pole number & 4 - 10 & - \\
Diameter & 40 - 60 & cm \\
Positions (x,y) & 2.1 - 7.9 $^*$ & m \\\hline\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\end{table}

\textbf{The Drone} is modeled from the observation of the AR-drone quad-rotor. Four circles with a heading indicator is used to visualized the drone with diameter of 0.4 m, in a top-down view as shown in Figure~\ref{f:TopViewSamples}. The drone motion is modeled using only linear kinematic equations with velocity changes, treating the drone as a point mass. Heading orientation is added to support the camera-view model. The model also consist of a random addition to simulate Drone drifting in the real life. 

\textbf{Camera-view} is modeled based on the pin-hole camera model, coupled with the specification of the AR-drone front camera. The result can be observed, from a random position of obstacle, in Figure~\ref{f:CameraViewSamples}. Further calibration is conducted to match the result with the sample pictures (Figure~\ref{f:Calibrations}) taken from zero altitude with a pole positioned 0.5, 1 and 2 meters infront of the camera, resulting in a field of view of 44 degree vertically, and 77 degree horizontally, as also shown by the dashed line coming from the front of the drone, in the top-down view Figure~\ref{f:TopViewSamples}.

\subsubsection{Strategy Implementation Result}
The implemented strategy is as described in the previous section, summarized in the flow chart in Figure~\ref{fp1}. The result is shown in series of frames (time-captured) as can be observed in Figure~\ref{f:Simulation_8Poles}, for the situation where eight poles is used. The first strategy is tested in random obstacle configuration in the tournament field. It should be noted that the result shown in this report is not the best result for the strategy proposed, since it result in four collisions. Tuning of thresholds is required, which unfortunately have not been conducted thoroughly in this simulation due the limitation of time.
