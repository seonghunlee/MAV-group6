\subsubsection{Computer Vision}
We start this section with two views concerning computer vision: David Marr's view is that the goal of the visual system is to invert the imaging process and the third dimension is added using the perceptual information provided by the eyes. On the other hand, American psychologist James Gibson stated that perception alone is enough to make sense of the world in a direct way. Processing is unnecessary because the perceived elements are detailed enough for us to interact directly with the environment.
